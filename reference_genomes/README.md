Reference genome files can be found in the private Amazon S3 bucket "saber-plish-barcodes/reference_genomes".

Copy the directory in it called "GRCh38.p14/" into your local machine into a directory called "reference_genomes" when running the workflow.sh file.

If possible, place the "reference_genomes" directory in the same directory as the "workflow.sh" file.
