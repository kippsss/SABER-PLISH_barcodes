# SABER-PLISH_barcodes

This repository contains all the scripts used in the computational design of DNA barcode libraries for use in SABER-PLISH.

Documentation to improve its reusability has yet to be completed.

The DNA barcode libraries generated are not uploaded here due to large file sizes. They will instead be uploaded to a private Amazon S3 bucket.
